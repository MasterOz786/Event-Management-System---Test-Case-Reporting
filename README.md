# Event Registration System Test Case Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test case documentation for the Event Registration System, utilizing two primary testing techniques:
1. Equivalence Class Partitioning (Weak Testing)
2. Boundary Value Analysis

## Testing Techniques

### 1. Equivalence Class Partitioning
Equivalence Class Partitioning divides input data into valid and invalid partitions to reduce the total number of test cases while maintaining effective coverage.

### 2. Boundary Value Analysis
Boundary Value Analysis focuses on testing the boundaries of input ranges to identify potential edge case failures.

## Test Report

The report is uploaded on Google Drive, generated through a personal Report Generation System built
on pure HTML, CSS and JS.

## Testing Approach
1. Identified valid and invalid input partitions
2. Tested boundary conditions
3. Covered various scenarios including:
   - Positive test cases
   - Negative test cases
   - Edge case scenarios
   - Invalid input handling

## Recommendations
1. Implement robust input validation
2. Provide clear error messages
3. Ensure consistent user experience across different scenarios
4. Continuously update test cases as system requirements evolve

## Tools and Methodology
- Testing Techniques: Equivalence Class Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis
- Test Case Management: Manual test case design
- Coverage: Comprehensive across multiple system features

## Limitations
- Some scenarios may require additional real-world testing
- Automated testing could provide more comprehensive coverage

## Notes for Developers
- Pay special attention to boundary conditions
- Implement thorough input validation
- Design user-friendly error messaging
